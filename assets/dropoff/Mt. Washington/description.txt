<p>If you are into hiking/nature and you live in new england region chances are you have either tried hiking up Mt. Washington or have it some where in your to-do list. For me, I am lucky enough to be friends with Akarsha who is a fellow softeware enginner who is very passionate about hiking and take it super seriously. I had hiked with him in other trails that were less challenging that this one, and although I am always the last and slowest one in the pack, he made a judgement that I was fit enough to hike up Mt. Washington. Ohh boy he was grossly wrong about hiking prowess. </p>

<p>We picked saturday as our goto date as usual because nobody wants to face monday with sore body and mind, atleast not me. We started early, around 6AM and it was solid 3hrs drive from Boston to the starting spot of Tuckerman Ravine route which begins at the Appalachian Mountain Club Pinkham Notch Visitor Center on Route 16. We were aware of mood swings that mother nature can throw up there, so we were fairly well prepared for the hike - first aid kit, torch light, good hiking bag, water pouch (3 ltr), jacket, gloves, power bars and most importantly the mind set. </p>

<p>It took us good 4 hours to hike all the way up. The view was just gorgeous, although it was cloudy and it rained, but still it was the most rewarding part of the hike. After a brief rest in the visitor's center we continued our long decend back following the lion head route. </p>
